2. Under `Repository` type `ghaithdallaali/steamguard-cli`
3. Under the Storage Configuration tab:
   - Add a new mount
   - **Host Path**: Select your dataset where your [previously generated maFiles](https://github.com/dyc3/steamguard-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) will be stored (e.g., `/mnt/pool/steamguard`)
   - **Mount Path**: Set to `/root/.config/steamguard-cli`
4. Under the Networking tab:
   - Add a port mapping from port 8080 (container) to a port of your choice (node)
5. After deployment, place your Steam Guard `.maFile` files in the dataset you selected at:
   `/mnt/pool/steamguard/maFiles/`
6. Access the web interface at `http://YOUR_TRUENAS_IP:YOUR_CHOSEN_PORT`
